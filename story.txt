There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely. She lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services.....
(CV) One day, a young boy dressed in rags, barefoot, his hair in a messy brown pile atop his head, knocked on the door of the cottage of the old woman. He had heard word around the town of her kind heart and was in search of a place to stay. She smiled at the boy, and, letting him into the small cottage she called home, gave him what small meal she could offer.
(NW) The young boy stayed with the kind old lady for a few years.  They treated each other like a family.  The old woman would run the neighbours' errands and and boy would help them with any maunal labor from farming to spliting logs.  Then one day, the kind old lady got sick and asked the boy to go get help.  The boy went into town to find the doctor and ask for help, but when he asked the doctor for help the doctor said what his price.  The priced was either too much money that they did not have or the boy would become the doctors servant.  The boy wanted to save the kind old lady, so he decided to become a servant.  When the nighbours heard of the situation they decided to help pitch in and pay for the medicine because the help that both the old woman and the boy do is greatly appreciated.
