There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely. She lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services.....
One day, a young boy dressed in rags, barefoot, his hair in a messy brown pile atop his head, knocked on the door of the cottage of the old woman. He had heard word around the town of her kind heart and was in search of a place to stay. She smiled at the boy, and, letting him into the small cottage she called home, gave him what small meal she could offer.
